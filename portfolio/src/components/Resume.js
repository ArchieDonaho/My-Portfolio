              <li>
                NOVEMBER 2017 - OCTOBER 2018: BACKROOM WORKER, SILVERS PET AND
                FEED
              </li>
              <div>
                Kept up with the inventory of the warehouse, loaded animal feed
                and hay bales onto customers vehicles, helped organize and clean
                the warehouse. Very physically demanding work.

              </li>
              <div>
                Stocked items and kept up with inventory for automotive. Also
                wrote up customers for services, helping them decide the best
                course of action to help maintain their vehicle. I helped them
                decide on batteries, tires, and oil changes that best suited the
                customers needs. Also was the first person that a customer would
                talk to for any additional help. Also, I was tasked to watch
                over the sales floor and check customers out at the service
                counter.

                bulbs, restored headlights, vacuumed/cleaned windshields, also
                helped service write when needed. I was a closer, and in charge
                of the closing crew composed of 2-3 additional associates. If
                needed, I would also watch the service counter to help the
                service writers if things got crowded. Additionally, I would
                help customers on the sales floor find the product they were
                looking for.

                matinence or repairs. I was to keep up with the customer and
                inform them with updates on their service. I was the face of the
                Mazda service center.

                responsibility to do things right and quickly with little room
                for error.
